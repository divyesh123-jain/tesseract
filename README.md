Certainly! Tesseract is <b>not</b> a JavaScript library, but rather an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google. It allows you to extract text from various types of images, such as scanned documents, photographs, or PDF files.

To use Tesseract with JavaScript, you can utilize a wrapper library called "tesseract.js." This library provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Tesseract OCR engine in a JavaScript environment, including Node.js.
