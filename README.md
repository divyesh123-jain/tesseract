Certainly! Tesseract is <b>not</b> a JavaScript library, but rather an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google. It allows you to extract text from various types of images, such as scanned documents, photographs, or PDF files.
<br>
To use Tesseract with JavaScript, you can utilize a wrapper library called "tesseract.js." This library provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Tesseract OCR engine in a JavaScript environment, including Node.js.

To convert PDF data into JSON format using Tesseract with Node.js, you can follow these steps:
<br>
Initialize your project:
Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project.

<br>This command initializes a new Node.js project and creates a package.json file where you can manage your project's dependencies.</br>
<br>
install the required packages:

<br>This command installs both the tesseract.js library and the pdf2json library, which we will use to convert the PDF to a more accessible format.</br>
<br>Create a JavaScript file:
Create a file named app.js (or any other desired name) in your project directory. This file will contain the code for converting the PDF data to JSON.</br>
<br>Write the conversion code:
In the app.js file, write the following code:</br>

<br>
Run the code:
Save the app.js file and execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
